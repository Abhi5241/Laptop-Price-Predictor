Laptop_Price_Predictor
Designed a web app that predicts the price of the laptop given the configurations.
Developed Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to get the best model.
Deployed the Machine Learning model using streamlit library in Heroku.
Feature Engineering
We go through all the features one by one and keep adding new features. I have made the following changes and created new variables: RAM - Made columns for Ram Capacity in GB and the DDR version Processor - Made columns for Name of the Processor, Type of the Processor, Generation Operating System - Parsed the Operating System from this column and made a new column Storage - Made new columns for the type of Disk Drive and the capacity of the Disk Drive Display - Made new columns for the size of the laptop(in inches) and touchscreen Description - Made new columns for the company and graphic card

Data Preprocessing
There are a few columns which are categorical here but they actually contain numerical values.So we need to convert few categorical columns to numerical columns. These are DDR_Version,Generation,Storage_GB,Price
